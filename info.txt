Build back-end of Vidly (Imaginary service for renting out movies)

Create service for managing the list of genres, so each movie has a genre like action, horror etc.

Endpoint for getting a list for all genres, because somewhere in the client application, we might have a drop-down list for the user to select a genre.

Update or delete an existing one.

Never trust ANY data sent by the client. Always validate! 

Use @hapi/joi for input validation and showing errors
